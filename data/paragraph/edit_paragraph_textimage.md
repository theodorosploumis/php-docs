This Element type is like Columns but its fields and display is predefined.

It has an Image (Media) and Text as also as some styling options.

If you need to create more advanced Image & Text combinations use the "Columns" Element instead.

Notice that you need to set the two columns using the "General Styling" options otherwise the items will stack one 
under the other.
