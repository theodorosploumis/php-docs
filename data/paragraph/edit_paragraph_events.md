Use this simple type of Element to display four items of the [Nodes of type "News & Events"](/#slug-node_news_dashboard).

Only Events that have values on the "Event Date(s)" field appear to this dynamic list.

Events grouped by day and display in tabs (each day is one tab) and sort by "event date" (upcoming come first).

Authors have option to choose if they want to "Show only Today events" or "Show Today, Tomorrow and the Day after" 
events (if any). 

Element of type "Events" has the "General Styling" options. 
See Element "[Free Text/Title](/#slug-edit_paragraph_text)" above to learn more about this field.
