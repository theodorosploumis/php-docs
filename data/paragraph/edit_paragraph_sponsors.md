Use this simple type of Element to display four items of the [Reusable Data of type "Sponsor"](/#slug-admin_dashboard_sponsors).

If the Reusable Data item is not available you need to create it firstly.

Element of type "Sponsors" has the "General Styling" options. 
See Element "[Free Text/Title](/#slug-edit_paragraph_text)" above to learn more about this field.

Grand Sponsor logo is larger that others.

Any other Sponsor display one next to the other using the same sorting from the "Add/Edit Element" form.
