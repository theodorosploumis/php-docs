Use this type of Element to add simple text or plain Titles above other Elements.

Element of type "Free Text/Title" has the "General Styling" options. 

"General Styling" field holds special css classes that affect the output of the Element. 
They are shared across most of the Elements (except from some Elements that do not need them).

Notice that some General Styling options do not apply on every Element. Eg the "2 columns of 50% width each" option 
works only when there are more than one column on the Element.
