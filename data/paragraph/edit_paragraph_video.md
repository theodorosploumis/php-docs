Use this simple type of Element to display one of the [Media of type "Video"](/#slug-admin_dashboard_media).

If the Media Video item is not available you need to create it firstly.

Element of type "Video" has the "General Styling" options. 
See Element "[Free Text/Title](/#slug-edit_paragraph_text)" above to learn more about this field.
