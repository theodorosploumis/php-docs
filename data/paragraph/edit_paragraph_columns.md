This is an Element to create advanced structured data using other Elements. 
It is a builder with endless combinations.

It allows Authors to create two or more Columns with data and stack them automatically according to the General Styling 
selected options.

A Column can contain other Columns too. The available Elements inside a Column are:

- Columns
- Hero Image
- Iframe
- Free Text/Title
- Events List
- Text + Image
- Member List
- Quote
- Image, Text, Button
- News List
- Sponsors List
- Video 

Notice that in order to keep your pages simple and manageable do not use more than a four column list. 
Also, keep the inner Elements as simple as possible otherwise design can break easily for each Column.

Element of type "Columns" has the "General Styling" options. 
See Element "[Free Text/Title](/#slug-edit_paragraph_text)" above to learn more about this field.
