Edit form is the same as Add New form. Please go to [this section](/#slug-add_node_news) to see more.

You can "Edit" an existing node:

- Through the [Dashboard: Administer News & Events](/#slug-node_news_dashboard) table.
- From the view node display by clicking the "Edit" button on the left options.
- Directly by typing `/node/[ID]/edit` on the browser where `[ID]` is the node unique id.
