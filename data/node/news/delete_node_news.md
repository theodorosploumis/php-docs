You can "Delete" an existing node:

- Through the [Dashboard: Administer News & Events](/#slug-node_news_dashboard) table.
- From the view node display by clicking the "Delete" button on the left options.
- Directly by typing `/node/[ID]/delete` on the browser where `[ID]` is the node unique id.

When you decide to "Delete" a node you go to a confirmation form (see below) where you need to confirm your decision.
