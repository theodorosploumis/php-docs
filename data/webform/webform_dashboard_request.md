In this Administration page you can see all the submissions of form "Publication Request" with their basic fields.

Results display in a dynamic table. On the table header some column labels are links. When you click these you can 
sort by each column value.

Every time you are filtering the results you can see the result number as also as the results on each page 
(if there are more pages).
