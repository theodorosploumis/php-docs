- Forms (aka Drupal Webforms) are special templates that store user submissions as data.
- Each Form has its own fields and settings.
- Each Form sends an email to the site Managers or even to the submitter.
- For every Form there is a dedicated backend page where Managers can see the results, download the results, resend the email etc.

There are three different forms on this website:

- Contact form
- eNewsletter form
- Publication request form
