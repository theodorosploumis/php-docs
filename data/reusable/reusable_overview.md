Reusable are templates that create and store extra "reusable" simple content entities.

Each Reusable type has specific fields and requirements.

Available Reusable types are "Counter", "Sponsor", and "Iframe".

Reusable do not have a standalone page like Nodes, but they are used as reference fields inside other types (Nodes or Elements).

Reusable do have Revisions too like Nodes and Media.

Every time you are filtering the results you can see the result number as also as the results on each page 
(if there are more pages).
