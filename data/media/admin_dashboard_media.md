In this Administration page you can see all the site Media.

Media is a template that creates reusable rich media content like Images, Video (from 3rd party providers) and Files (Attachment).

Each media type has specific fields and requirements.

Available Media types are "Background Image", "Hero Image", "Image (Generic)", "Report/Attachment" and "Video."

Media do not have a standalone page like Nodes, but they are used as reference fields inside other types (Nodes or Elements).

Examples of media is a Hero banner attached to the Homepage or a Video for the Grand Gourmet node page.

The results display in a dynamic grid.

Every time you are filtering the results you can see the result number as also as the results on each page 
(if there are more pages).
